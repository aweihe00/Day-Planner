Overview
When developers find themselves repeating a task, they tend to look for a way to simplify their workflow. We saw earlier how CSS frameworks were developed to ensure consistency across applications and to expedite developer workflows. Tools with similar goals have emerged in the JavaScript ecosystem.
jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than we'd need to if we were using plain ol' JavaScript to accomplish the same end. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.
Some argue that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. You might not see as many job listings for jQuery developers, but itâ€™s an important skill to master as the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code

Homework: Day Planner
